# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation hub. This collection of guides and best practices serves as the central knowledge base for how OctoAcme runs cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, and integrations.

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative delivery approach built on clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our project management framework encompasses the complete project lifecycle—from initial problem identification through delivery, deployment, and retrospective analysis. Each phase is guided by well-defined principles that emphasize delivering small, testable increments while maintaining transparency and alignment across all stakeholders. Projects are managed through a structured five-phase lifecycle: Initiation (problem statement and stakeholder alignment), Planning (scope definition and resource allocation), Execution (iterative build and test cycles), Release (deployment and verification), and Close & Retrospective (capturing learnings and defining next steps).

At the heart of our project management approach are clearly defined roles and responsibilities that ensure smooth collaboration and accountability. Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications, while Product Managers define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success. Developers implement features and collaborate on design and testability, while QA/Testing validates quality and acceptance criteria. This role clarity, combined with regular communication cadences—including weekly PM-Product Manager syncs, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates—ensures that everyone stays aligned and informed throughout the project lifecycle.

Our quality assurance and continuous improvement practices are embedded throughout the process. Every project maintains key artifacts including project charters, roadmaps, sprint backlogs, acceptance criteria, risk registers, and retrospective notes. Quality is ensured through comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests), security scanning in CI pipelines, and manual QA validation. Risk management is proactive and systematic, with risks identified, assessed, mitigated, and monitored through regular reviews. After each sprint, release, or milestone, teams conduct structured retrospectives to capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements, fostering a culture of continuous enhancement and innovation.
